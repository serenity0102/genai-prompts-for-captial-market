    "Apple’s Mac and iPad Sales Remain Bolstered by Work-From-Home Trend in Q4; Raising FVE to $85\n",
    "\n",
    "Apple reported fiscal fourth-quarter results ahead of our expectations led by Mac and iPad segments.\n",
    "The firm did not provide guidance the last two quarters and again refrained from offering specific guidance due to uncertainty regarding COVID-19. CEO Tim Cook expects iPhone revenue to grow in the December quarter despite the new iPhone 12 being launched a couple of weeks later in the quarter, though he did not specify the magnitude of growth. Meanwhile, all other products and services are expected to grow in the double digits.\n",
    "We are raising our fair value estimate for narrow-moat Apple to $85 per share from $71 as we incorporate a stronger near-term outlook for the Mac and iPad segments due to ongoing work- and learning-from-home dynamics. Nonetheless, we think shares are currently overvalued, as we think recent growth trends could be unsustainable as we enter 2021.\n",
    "Fourth-quarter revenue was up 1% year over year thanks to growth in iPad (46%), Mac (29%), services (16%), and wearables, home, and accessories (21%). Management noted the iPad and Mac segments remained supply constrained, which bodes well for these business lines in the December quarter.\n",
    "Apple’s iPhone sales were understandably down 21% year over year due to the iPhone 12 delay. Apple now has over 585 million paid subscribers to its various services, up 135 million from a year ago, and the firm expects 600 million subs by Dec 2020. Although Greater China was the region most impacted by the absence of the new iPhones for the quarter (total revenue down 29% year over year), non-iPhone sales grew double digits. Gross margin of 38.2% was up 20 basis points sequentially due to a higher mix of services.\n",
    "Management was optimistic revenue from Greater China would grow in the first quarter, particularly as 5G is more mature in the region. We anticipate iPhone revenue for fiscal 2021 will be up in the low teens, though the late launch may shift some sales from the December quarter to the March quarter.\n",

      "Revenue of $111.4 billion was up 21% year-over-year, with double-digit growth across all product categories and services. iPhone revenue of $65.6 billion increased 17% despite the delayed launch timing, benefiting from strong demand for the first 5G-enabled iPhone 12 lineup. Services revenue grew 24% to $15.8 billion, with paid subscriptions surpassing 620 million. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are maintaining our $85 fair value estimate for narrow-moat Apple as we incorporate the impressive first-quarter results and outlook. However, shares appear modestly overvalued as we believe some of the recent elevated growth trends may prove unsustainable as we move through 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "iPhone revenue rebounded sharply following the delayed iPhone 12 launch, with growth across all regions led by a nearly 57% surge in Greater China. Mac and iPad sales remained robust, up 21% and 41% respectively, as work/learn-from-home dynamics persisted. Wearables, home, and accessories increased 30%.\n",

      "Gross margin of 39.8% expanded 170 basis points sequentially due to a favorable product mix. The Americas remained Apple's largest region at $46.3 billion in sales, up 12% year-over-year. Greater China revenue soared 57% to $21.3 billion as 5G proliferation drove strong iPhone 12 demand.\n",

      "Management expects revenue growth to accelerate in the March quarter compared to the 21% growth posted in Q1.
