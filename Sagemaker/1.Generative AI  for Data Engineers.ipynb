Year-over-year revenue growth: The year-over-year revenue growth can be calculated by subtracting the revenue of the previous year from the current year's revenue and then dividing by the revenue of the previous year, and multiplying by 100 to get the percentage. According to the report, the total revenue in 2019 was $91,819 million. Thus, the year-over-year revenue growth is [($111,439 - $91,819) / $91,819] x 100 = 20.5%.\n",

      "3. iPhone revenue: To extract the iPhone revenue, you can refer to the section \"Net sales by category\" of the report. The revenue generated from iPhone sales was $65,597 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Current cash asset: You can find the current cash asset by looking at the \"Cash and cash equivalents\" under the \"Current assets\" section of the balance sheet. According to the report, the current cash asset was $37,719 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Return on Equity (ROE): To calculate ROE, you'll need the net income, total assets, and shareholders' equity. According to the report, net income was $28,755 million, total assets were $354,054 million, and total shareholders' equity was $66,224 million. Therefore, ROE is [($28,755 / $66,224)] x 100 = 43.32%.\n",
